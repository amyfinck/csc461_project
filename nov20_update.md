## Responses to Peer Questions 
*Q:* Given the proprietary nature of the IMAX compression algorithm, how will you address this challenge in your research? Are there any potential ways to get this information, or do you plan to focus on the public aspects of IMAX technology?

*Response:* Due to the limited time and resources for this project, we are planning to focus on the aspects of IMAX technology that are publicly available so we will not be attempting to include any proprietary information. Our plan to address the challenges surrounding understanding the compression methods used is to spend more time doing deeper research into the IMAX compression to obtain all non proprietary information that there is available. 

*Q:* Given that IMAX's digital theatres are capable of 4K at most, what do you think the purpose of shooting their new films in 12K might be?

*Response:* There are many benefits to shooting films at higher resolution than what the theatres are capable of displaying. It provides more flexibility in the post-processing to be able to crop, zoom, and make other edits without sacrificing any of the quality of the image. Many movies also now incorporate forms of CGI and visual effects which have more seamless integration when the initial quality is at higher resolution. Additionally, the higher the resolution, the more pixel data there is which helps with 3D tracking and stabilizing a shot in post-production. Here is a resource we found that discusses why filming in 4K is beneficial even if the final resolution will be lower, which is a bit different but the same principles apply with 12K vs 4K:

# Current State of Research 
After our first biweekly update, we felt we had gathered enough sources to understand the technical details of IMAX. We received feedback that we should now start to clarify the information that we got, and to organise our sources. Below, we have sorted our resources into the categories on which we would like to focus on, and synthesised the information in paragraph format. We determined we would like to write about the technical history of IMAX, the IMAX visual specifications, audio specifications, compression algorithms, and the future of IMAX. We also found that the large range of specifications for different IMAX theatres had the potential to make our topic too broad. To give the reader a greater understanding of modern IMAX technology, we decided to survey the three true IMAX theatres in BC to compare the technology that they employ. Writing this initial draft allowed us to determine which information we would like to focus on, and prompted us to do some additional research in areas where we had less information. We hope to continue to expand and clarify this information in the next two weeks. 

## History of IMAX
IMAX has undergone significant technological advancements throughout its history. The world was first exposed to IMAX at Expo 67 in Montreal, with a film titled “Labyrinthe” [1]. This film used a total of 5 screens, some of which projected 70mm film. At this time, the company was actually called Multiscreen, and wanted to produce more multi-screen movies. However after Expo 67, they decided to focus on the presentation of high quality 70 mm films on a single screen. 

IMAX separates itself from other theatres by its large, high quality video projection. The standard for film at the time was, and still largely is for movies that still use film, 35 mm film. This means that the width of the film strips is approximately 35 mm in length. IMAX is largely known for the use of 70 mm film [2]. Each frame is 15 performations wide, so this format is often referred to as 15/70. This makes it the largest commercial film format in motion picture history [4]. One other major innovation IMAX made was running the film through the projector horizontally, meaning the width of the film was the height of the frame. Conventionally, film was run vertically through projectors. [2]. 

IMAX has continued to make innovations to its format over the years. IMAX remained analog until 2008, when it launched IMAX digital. It initially used 2K projection and a proprietary method of image processing, and had an aspect ratio of 1.9 [2]. In 2015, it launched IMAX with laser. This used two 4k laser projectors, and has an aspect ratio of 1.43. IMAX laser screens can reach over 80 ft wide. IMAX lasers ensure deeper, darker, better colours and an overall improvement in the image quality. 
Lasers cause less eye strain to look at for the viewer compared to xenon bulbs, and they are cheaper and need to be replaced less frequently than bulbs. However, IMAXs’ signature 70/15 format still remains in many theatres. 

IMAX also launched a dome theatre with IMAX laser in 2018. This uses a single GT laser projector, and has an aspect ratio of 1.43. In an IMAX dome theatre, the projector is placed in the centre of the dome on an elevator. This format cannot do frame rates higher than 48 fps and the 48fps is only achieved by dropping to 2K resolutions. According to IMAX, they do not have any plans to improve this resolution. 

## IMAX visual quality specifications

As mentioned in the history of IMAX, IMAX has distinguished itself by both high quality and high size video projection. The 70/15 video format has allowed for clear image quality, as well as allowing the film to look good on larger screens. IMAX screens can reach up to 80 ft in width. The intent behind this is to have the screens extend beyond your peripheral vision, in order to provide a fully immersive experience [4]. IMAX’s technology of running the film through the projector horizontally is called ‘Rolling Loop’ technology, and is patented by IMAX [4]. The frame rate is 24 fps, which is the standard in the industry. 

IMAX digital is capable of 60 fps frame rates. It is 4K, and capable of displaying colours in a huge colour gamut called Rec. 2020. The lasers provide 50% greater brightness than the DCI specification, which is the standard in digital cinema. It also allows IMA to achieve a contrast that is double that of the IMAX 15/70 film projection [4]. 
IMAX audio specifications

While IMAX may be known for their high quality visual specifications, they have also focused on delivering high quality, immersive audio experiences. The audio has historically been supplied on a 35 mm sprocket magnetic film, which ran at 45.7 cm per second [5]. This featured 6 separate audio channels. In 1988, IMAX acquired Sonics Associates as an affiliate, which was considered a world-leader in sound design. Together, they designed a digital standard for IMAX. A frequency response of 20 – 20.000 Hz is maintained over the entire audio spectrum of ten octaves, compared to the 6 octaves found in conventional cinemas [5]. Three CD’s are used for each soundtrack, one CD for every 2 channels. In total, many IMAX 4K theatres use 12 channels of audio, compared to the standard 5 channels employed in most theatres. 

## IMAX compression
We are hoping to discuss the video compression format that IMAX uses, but we have been unable to find any reliable sources so far. We have found a couple of forums which suggest they use the JPEG200 format, but we are hoping to ensure we have more information by the final report. However it is possible that their compression algorithm is proprietary, and we may not be able to find out as much information as we would like. 

## IMAX Theatres in BC
IMAX has three ‘true IMAX’ theatres in BC. By true IMAX, we mean that they either use 4K laser projection or the 70/15 analog format. The first one is IMAX Victoria, which uses 4K Laser Projection. It is the largest screen in BC, at 25.63 m × 18.68 m. It is capable of 3D. IMAX Vancouver is located inside Science World, and it is an OMNIMAX IMAX Dome theatre. It is not currently operational. It is 27m, and uses 70/15 projection. Finally, IMAX Langley has a screen of 21.3m x 16m. IMAX Langley uses IMAX 15/70 projection. 

## Future of IMAX 
IMAX has been continually evolving its technology, and is likely to continue to do so. In recent years, they’ve  introduced the "Filmed In IMAX" program, certifying high-quality digital cameras for IMAX-format films [6]. A notable development is IMAX's plan to transition to filming with 12K cameras, exemplified by the upcoming film "Koala," shot using the Blackmagic URSA Mini Pro 12K [6]. 

While IMAX is looking to continue to expand the quality in some of their theatres, they also have been looking to gain prominence outside of expensive IMAX theatres [8] This vision for the future, represented by "IMAX 3.0," aims to deliver high-quality entertainment experiences on screens of various sizes, expanding beyond traditional theatres. They have introduced 'Stream Smart,' [9] developed in collaboration with Disney, with the goal of delivering high-quality video at reduced distribution costs [7]. IMAX has also opened up a large number of theatres which show 2K video at a more traditional screen size. These are often opened in movie theatres themselves, and has been been termed ‘lie-max’ [10] by sone due to not meeting the IMAX expectations of a large screen and stunning visual and audio quality. 

## New Research from Resources Provided in Peer Feedback
[11] Oppenheimer Just Made Movie History: How the Christopher Nolan Film Changed IMAX
- Link: https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/oppenheimer-imax-christopher-nolan/
- Christopher Nolan's "Oppenheimer" challenges IMAX technology by shifting from action-packed scenes to intimate political and scientific moments.
- Since the film shifts often between action-packed scenes and more political, extended dialogue moments, IMAX cameras face a unique application challenge so the cinematography team experimented by shooting on 65mm initially and transitioning to IMAX for select sequences when needed 
- This movie was historic in cinema due to their creation of 70mm black and white IMAX film stocks, which is accompanied by technical adjustments in camera mechanics and film processing.
- The film's cinematic laboratory approach includes the creation of a snorkel lens for IMAX cameras, which was developed by Panavision; it provides a unique perspective for capturing scenes in confined spaces.
- "Oppenheimer" explores the quantum world using in-camera IMAX photography, opting for practical effects like micro photography. This approach, alongside the use of a snorkel lens, enhances the tangible and authentic representation of the molecular realm.
- The snorkel lens is employed in water tanks which offers a practical approach to capturing scenes or visuals representing aspects of quantum physics.
- The film balances practical effects with real-world filming, particularly for sequences depicting the atomic explosion at the test site Trinity. This emphasizes the importance of authentic visuals in specific cinematic scenarios.

[12] IMAX 101 Series: DMR (Digital Re-Mastering)—The Secret Sauce Behind The IMAX Experience
- Link:https://web.archive.org/web/20150109181705/http://www.imax.com/community/blog/imax-101-series-a-deeper-dive-into-dmr/
- DMR (Digital Media Remastering) is a transformative process behind IMAX technology. Image Re-mastering involves scanning and converting 35mm film frames into high-resolution digital images.
- IMAX collaborates with filmmakers, using proprietary tools for image enhancement.
- Techniques include detail enhancement, artifact removal, increased brightness, and contrast.
- The process is collaborative, involving filmmakers' input to achieve both technical and creative goals.
- The enhanced digital signal is recorded onto 15/70 film or an IMAX DCP for projection.
- Sound Re-mastering involves remixing original tracks to optimize for IMAX theatres' sound systems.
- IMAX's control over theatre design allows for a unique and optimized soundtrack.

[13] The Eye of Daedalus 
- Has a chapter that explores the technical and aesthetic qualities of IMAX 3D films within the larger context of IMAX development and explains how IMAX 3D positions the spectator differently than 2D scenarios to influence viewer experience
- Debunks 5 myths about IMAX 3D: Myth #1: All IMAX is 3D; Myth #2: In IMAX 3D, the screen disappears; Myth #3: The IMAX viewer is absorbed into the image; Myth #4: IMAX 3D simulates human perception; Myth #5: An IMAX movie is the closest thing to being there
- Conventional 3D films emphasize the emergence of objects from the screen, whereas IMAX 3D focuses on representing volumes, creating a truly three-dimensional visual matrix.
- The geometrical arrangement of IMAX 3D is quite complex, the window appears large enough to crawl through, the film frame corresponds to the body's frame, allowing objects to move around and even past the viewer, and objects can even approach from behind
- Speakers also play a large role in the effect of IMAX 3D by being placed in all directions so that the sensations of objects moving past or approaching from behind can be created
