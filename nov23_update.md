# November 23 Bi-Weekly Update - Data Gathering and Preliminary Research

## Introduction
This bi-weekly update is to provide an overview of the preliminary research and data gathering we have done into the specifications of different IMAX screens and technologies, the history of the IMAX experience, and the different directions that IMAX is moving in. Our project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the advanced multimedia technologies utilized by IMAX to identify what makes it so unique, as well as potential areas for enhancement in the future.

## History of IMAX 
### [1] Large Formats 
Link: https://lfexaminer.com/large-formats/
1. 15/70: 
- Launched in 1970
- Uses 70 mm film run through projector horizontally (makes the width of the film the height of the frame), conventional film was run vertically through projectors
- Each frame is 15 perforations wide (reason for the name 15/70)
2. IMAX digital: 
- Launched in 2008
- Uses 2 Christie 2K projects and proprietary image processing
- Aspect ratio of 1.9 
3. IMAX with laser: 
- Launched in 2015
- Uses two 4K laser projectors
- Aspect ratio of 1.43
- Replaces the 15/70 film projection with screens over 80 feet wide 
4. Dome Theatre IMAX laser: 
- Launched in 2018
- Uses single GT laser projector
- Aspect ratio of 1.43
- Projector placed in centre of dome on an elevator (same method as the old dome projector that this is replacing) 
- This format cannot do frame rates higher than 48 fps and the 48fps is only achieved by dropping to 2K resolutions
- According to IMAX, they do not have any plans to improve this to be able to have a higher fps with the dome theatre laser  
5. Multiplexes Laser:
- Launched in 2018
- Laser projector for multiplexes
- Aspect ratio of 1.9

- In this IMAX projector the film is run horizontally, unlike the conventional projectors IMAX began to use lasers in its projectors because they ensure deeper, darker, better colours and an overall improvement in the image quality
- Lasers cause less eye strain to look at for the viewer (compared to xenon bulbs)
- Lasers are cheaper since they need to be replaced less frequently than bulbs 

## Current Specs of IMAX Technologies and Screens 
### [3] IMAX Technical Facts
Link: https://ewh.ieee.org/reg/7/millennium/imax/imax_technical.html
- IMAX is the largest commercial film format in motion picture history -- 70mm, 15-perforation
- Screens extend beyond your peripheral vision
- Films shot on 65mm negative stock
- Uses IMAX’s patented Rolling Loop technology for the projector

### IMAX Theatres in BC
Overall we have 3 ‘true IMAX’ theatres in BC, all three of which use different technology. 
Here, we refer to ‘true IMAX’ as either 4K laser projection or 15/70 mm.
The Victoria theatre only does digital projection, the Vancouver theatre is an analog dome theatre, and the Langley theatre is analog.
1. IMAX Victoria
- https://imaxvictoria.com/experience/
- IMAX Victoria does not use analog film, but instead 4K Laser Projection
- Biggest screen in BC, at 25.63 m × 18.68 m
2. IMAX Vancouver
- Currently not running, but this is an OMNIMAX IMAX Dome theatre
- 27 m, 15/70mm, 2D only
3. IMAX Langley
- 21.3 m × 16 m
- 15/70 1.43:1 and Digital 1.90:1

### [4] IMAX with Laser: Superb contrast, 4K resolution, and huge color gamuts
Link:https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/10/imax-with-laser-superb-contrast-4k-resolution-and-huge-colour-gamuts/
- This link is useful for understanding the specs of the “IMAX with Laser” 
- Uses laser-based light source instead of xenon arc lamps / pulps 
- Lasers provides 50% greater brightness than DCI spec which is the digital cinema standard 
- Contrast ratio with lasers is double that of the IMAX 15/70mm film projection 
- Full REC. 2020 gamut / colour space is available with laser projection but this is mostly unused (still uses P3 colour space) 

## Future of IMAX 

### [5] Shooting koalas in 12K for IMAX is as tricky as it sounds
https://www.popsci.com/story/technology/imax-12k-koala-movie-blackmagic-camera/
- The company is focued on digital formats for its future.
- IMAX Digital 2K and IMAX with Laser 4K in 2008 and 2014 respectively
- In September 2020, IMAX started the "Filmed In IMAX" program. This certifies high-quality digital cameras that can be used to create IMAX-format films
- IMAX wants to move to filming with 12K cameras. The upcoming film “Koala” will be the first shot in 12K, using the Blackmagic URSA Mini Pro 12K.

### [6] “IMAX to Present Its New Stream Smart Technology at IBC 2023
Link: https://www.imax.com/content/imax-brings-cutting-edge-stream-smart-technology-to-ibc
- This article helps show the future direction that IMAX is taking 
- IMAX is presenting their vision of IMAX 3.0 that delivers high level entertainment experiences on various sizes of screens instead of just in traditional theatres and to advance streaming technologies 
- IMAX introduces ‘Stream Smart’ which was developed in collaboration with Disney and its goal is to deliver the highest-quality video at reduced distribution cost  

### [7] IMAX Enhanced
Link: https://www.imaxenhanced.com/
- Another new development of IMAX that helps to indicate the direction that IMAX is going in the future which is enhancing the experience for streaming 
- ‘IMAX Enhanced’ is a streaming method that is supposed to bring the most immersive viewing experience that is possible outside of a theatre

### [8] The shrinking IMAX Screen
Link: https://lfexaminer.com/2010/04/the-shrinking-imax-screen/
- The average screen size of new IMAX theatres is shrinking
- IMAX has opened many theatres with a smaller screen size and 2K projection
