# Project Proposal -  Multimedia Analysis of IMAX Technology 

The project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis and survey of the IMAX multimedia system, a leader in the cinematic, immersive experience industry. The IMAX system delivers an unmatched combination of outstanding audio, video, and images through advanced technologies. The IMAX experience sets itself apart from conventional films due to its extremely high resolution, massive screens, and â€¦ Our project would analyse the methods employed by IMAX to represent the content to the user. We will examine the representation features used such as the aspect ratio, resolutions, frame rates, audio formats, spatial sound technologies, etc. Additionally, we will examine any compression strategies that are executed by IMAX to handle and deliver the enormous file and data sizes associated with high quality, large-format films. We will approach our project by doing a comprehensive survey of IMAX theatres, gathering data on their audio systems, video projection technologies, image display mechanisms, and post-production processes. This project is important in finding valuable insights into the advanced multimedia technologies employed by IMAX and finding potential areas for improvement.
