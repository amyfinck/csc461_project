# Project Proposal -  Multimedia Analysis of IMAX Technology 

The project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis and survey of the IMAX multimedia system, a leader in the cinematic, immersive experience industry. The IMAX system delivers an unparalleled combination of exceptional audio, video, and images through cutting-edge technologies. The IMAX experience distinguishes itself from conventional films due to its exceptionally high resolution, expansive screens, and state-of-the-art visual and auditory immersion. Our project will analyze the methods employed by IMAX to present content to the user, delving into representation features such as aspect ratio, resolutions, frame rates, audio formats, spatial sound technologies, and more. Furthermore, we will investigate any compression strategies executed by IMAX to manage and deliver the vast file and data sizes associated with high-quality, large-format films.

Our approach involves a comprehensive survey of IMAX theaters, gathering data on their audio systems, video projection technologies, image display mechanisms, and post-production processes. We also would like to compare the technologies used to those employed by the standard movie theatre, and use this comparison both to gain a wider understanding of theatres as a whole, as well as be able to determine in what departments IMAX deviates from them. 

We also would like to explore the history of IMAX through the technology it employs. We know that IMAX is a Canadian company created in the 1970s, and at the time the IMAX format had not been seen before [1]. We would like to understand the technology it employed when it was founded, and what made it so different from other movie formats. We will then follow it through any format changes they have overgone throughout the years, and the improvement it had. In addition we will consider its future, and explore what we think could be updated in the coming years. 

This project is important in uncovering valuable insights into the advanced multimedia technologies utilized by IMAX while aiming to identify what makes IMAX so unique, as well as potential areas for enhancement in the future.
