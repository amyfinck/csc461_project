# Project Proposal -  Multimedia Analysis of IMAX Technology 

The project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis and survey of the IMAX multimedia system, a leader in the cinematic, immersive experience industry. The IMAX system delivers an unparalleled combination of exceptional audio, video, and images through cutting-edge technologies. The IMAX experience distinguishes itself from conventional films due to its exceptionally high resolution, expansive screens, and state-of-the-art visual and auditory immersion. Our project will analyze the methods employed by IMAX to present content to the user, delving into representation features such as aspect ratio, resolutions, frame rates, audio formats, spatial sound technologies, and more. Furthermore, we will investigate any compression strategies executed by IMAX to manage and deliver the vast file and data sizes associated with high-quality, large-format films. Our approach involves a comprehensive survey of IMAX theatres, gathering data on their audio systems, video projection technologies, image display mechanisms, and post-production processes. This project is important in uncovering valuable insights into the advanced multimedia technologies utilized by IMAX while aiming to identify what makes IMAX so unique and potential areas for enhancement.
