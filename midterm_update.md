Project: Multimedia Analysis of IMAX Technology

This midterm update is to provide an overview of the research and data gathering we have done, as well as challenges we have faced and an update on our progress with respect to the original schedule. We have researched into the specifications of different IMAX screens and technologies, the history of the IMAX experience, and the different directions that IMAX is moving in. In this update, we have organised the information that we have gathered into categories, and summarised our current knowledge in paragraph format. Our project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the advanced multimedia technologies utilised by IMAX to identify what makes it so unique, as well as potential areas for enhancement in the future.

## Technical Challenges 

We have found plenty of information on physical specs (such as screen size, aspect ratio, resolution) but it is hard to find the actual compression methods that are used to deliver such large amount of data needed for IMAX films. 
For future direction, there is lots of press statements on new streaming direction that IMAX is taking but little information on the actual compression methods used to deliver this high quality streaming. 

*Solution:*
We have started more directed research into the compression instead of general research on the evolution and history of IMAX We are aiming to do more research to ensure that we have checked all possible sources, but some of this information may be proprietary. 

## Questions / Addition Help Needed / Change Requests 
As mentioned in the technical challenges, we are having trouble finding reliable information on the compression algorithms IMAX digital uses for both audio and video compression. We will continue to research, but any ideas on where to find this information would be appreciated. 

We also received feedback from our TA that we should look at the source The eye of Daedalus: A history and theory of IMAX cinema. However, we didn't find it in the UVic library and could not find it online. Any advice on how to access this resource would be appreciated. 

# Current State of Research 
After our first biweekly update, we felt we had gathered enough sources to understand the technical details of IMAX. We received feedback that we should now start to clarify the information that we got, and to organise our sources. Below, we have sorted our resources into the categories on which we would like to focus on, and synthesised the information in paragraph format. We determined we would like to write about the technical history of IMAX, the IMAX visual specifications, audio specifications, compression algorithms, and the future of IMAX. We also found that the large range of specifications for different IMAX theatres had the potential to make our topic too broad. To give the reader a greater understanding of modern IMAX technology, we decided to survey the three true IMAX theatres in BC to compare the technology that they employ. Writing this initial draft allowed us to determine which information we would like to focus on, and prompted us to do some additional research in areas where we had less information. We hope to continue to expand and clarify this information in the next two weeks. 

## History of IMAX
IMAX has undergone significant technological advancements throughout its history. The world was first exposed to IMAX at Expo 67 in Montreal, with a film titled “Labyrinthe” [1]. This film used a total of 5 screens, some of which projected 70mm film. At this time, the company was actually called Multiscreen, and wanted to produce more multi-screen movies. However after Expo 67, they decided to focus on the presentation of high quality 70 mm films on a single screen. 

IMAX separates itself from other theatres by its large, high quality video projection. The standard for film at the time was, and still largely is for movies that still use film, 35 mm film. This means that the width of the film strips is approximately 35 mm in length. IMAX is largely known for the use of 70 mm film [2]. Each frame is 15 performations wide, so this format is often referred to as 15/70. This makes it the largest commercial film format in motion picture history [4]. One other major innovation IMAX made was running the film through the projector horizontally, meaning the width of the film was the height of the frame. Conventionally, film was run vertically through projectors. [2]. 

IMAX has continued to make innovations to its format over the years. IMAX remained analog until 2008, when it launched IMAX digital. It initially used 2K projection and a proprietary method of image processing, and had an aspect ratio of 1.9 [2]. In 2015, it launched IMAX with laser. This used two 4k laser projectors, and has an aspect ratio of 1.43. IMAX laser screens can reach over 80 ft wide. IMAX lasers ensure deeper, darker, better colours and an overall improvement in the image quality. 
Lasers cause less eye strain to look at for the viewer compared to xenon bulbs, and they are cheaper and need to be replaced less frequently than bulbs. However, IMAXs’ signature 70/15 format still remains in many theatres. 

IMAX also launched a dome theatre with IMAX laser in 2018. This uses a single GT laser projector, and has an aspect ratio of 1.43. In an IMAX dome theatre, the projector is placed in the centre of the dome on an elevator. This format cannot do frame rates higher than 48 fps and the 48fps is only achieved by dropping to 2K resolutions. According to IMAX, they do not have any plans to improve this resolution. 

## IMAX visual quality specifications

As mentioned in the history of IMAX, IMAX has distinguished itself by both high quality and high size video projection. The 70/15 video format has allowed for clear image quality, as well as allowing the film to look good on larger screens. IMAX screens can reach up to 80 ft in width. The intent behind this is to have the screens extend beyond your peripheral vision, in order to provide a fully immersive experience [4]. IMAX’s technology of running the film through the projector horizontally is called ‘Rolling Loop’ technology, and is patented by IMAX [4]. The frame rate is 24 fps, which is the standard in the industry. 

IMAX digital is capable of 60 fps frame rates. It is 4K, and capable of displaying colours in a huge colour gamut called Rec. 2020. The lasers provide 50% greater brightness than the DCI specification, which is the standard in digital cinema. It also allows IMA to achieve a contrast that is double that of the IMAX 15/70 film projection [4]. 
IMAX audio specifications

While IMAX may be known for their high quality visual specifications, they have also focused on delivering high quality, immersive audio experiences. The audio has historically been supplied on a 35 mm sprocket magnetic film, which ran at 45.7 cm per second [5]. This featured 6 separate audio channels. In 1988, IMAX acquired Sonics Associates as an affiliate, which was considered a world-leader in sound design. Together, they designed a digital standard for IMAX. A frequency response of 20 – 20.000 Hz is maintained over the entire audio spectrum of ten octaves, compared to the 6 octaves found in conventional cinemas [5]. Three CD’s are used for each soundtrack, one CD for every 2 channels. In total, many IMAX 4K theatres use 12 channels of audio, compared to the standard 5 channels employed in most theatres. 

## IMAX compression
We are hoping to discuss the video compression format that IMAX uses, but we have been unable to find any reliable sources so far. We have found a couple of forums which suggest they use the JPEG200 format, but we are hoping to ensure we have more information by the final report. However it is possible that their compression algorithm is proprietary, and we may not be able to find out as much information as we would like. 

## IMAX Theatres in BC
IMAX has three ‘true IMAX’ theatres in BC. By true IMAX, we mean that they either use 4K laser projection or the 70/15 analog format. The first one is IMAX Victoria, which uses 4K Laser Projection. It is the largest screen in BC, at 25.63 m × 18.68 m. It is capable of 3D. IMAX Vancouver is located inside Science World, and it is an OMNIMAX IMAX Dome theatre. It is not currently operational. It is 27m, and uses 70/15 projection. Finally, IMAX Langley has a screen of 21.3m x 16m. IMAX Langley uses IMAX 15/70 projection. 

## Future of IMAX 
IMAX has been continually evolving its technology, and is likely to continue to do so. In recent years, they’ve  introduced the "Filmed In IMAX" program, certifying high-quality digital cameras for IMAX-format films [6]. A notable development is IMAX's plan to transition to filming with 12K cameras, exemplified by the upcoming film "Koala," shot using the Blackmagic URSA Mini Pro 12K [6]. 

While IMAX is looking to continue to expand the quality in some of their theatres, they also have been looking to gain prominence outside of expensive IMAX theatres [8] This vision for the future, represented by "IMAX 3.0," aims to deliver high-quality entertainment experiences on screens of various sizes, expanding beyond traditional theatres. They have introduced 'Stream Smart,' [9] developed in collaboration with Disney, with the goal of delivering high-quality video at reduced distribution costs [7]. IMAX has also opened up a large number of theatres which show 2K video at a more traditional screen size. These are often opened in movie theatres themselves, and has been been termed ‘lie-max’ [10] by sone due to not meeting the IMAX expectations of a large screen and stunning visual and audio quality.
